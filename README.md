# Design Patterns in C# to teach my son

As a father, I want to teach my son about design patterns in C# so that he can understand how to write better code. This repository contains examples of various design patterns implemented in C#.
Also a great opportunity for me to learn more about design patterns and C#.
Maybe I'll use it for videos on YouTube.
